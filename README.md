# QuizApp
This is a simple quiz application.
It is designed for the user to imput his or her name and have the application ask it if they are a dog or cat person.  Then, with the questions below, the user is to pick from the switches provided to determine if they are a dog or cat person.  After they are done, they click submit and a picture of a dog or cat should pop up, along with a comment telling them their answer.

I demonstrated features like switches and buttons, and connecting them to the code so when the user imputs something, the app will respond with an answer or message.
